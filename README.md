## Octave/MATLAB Code Repository for Multi Criteria Decision Making Methods

This repository contains Octave/MATLAB code for Multi Criteria Decision Making Methods. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine or Download the zip file and extract the folder. 
2. Install [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) on your machine.
3. Open Octave and navigate to the directory where you cloned/unzipped this repository.
   Create 3 Null Matrix namely X, W and Wcriteria.
- where X is the decision Matrix (X=[ ]). Paste the values of decision matrix.
- W is the weights of the criteria (W=[ ]). Paste the value of weights.
- Wcriteria tells us that the criteria is beneficial or non-beneficial (Wcriteria=[ ]). For beneficial criteira type "1" and for non-beneficial criteria type "0"
    
4. Run the Octave script in the command line.<br>
